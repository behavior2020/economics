# Project Data Analysis

Welcome to my GitHub Data Analysis page! Here, you'll find an extensive showcase of my Python & SQL projects, demonstrating my capabilities in tackling real-world data problems. The projects range from survey data analysis and stock market evaluations to comprehensive sales data investigations.

Every repository is a testament to my proficiency in Python and SQL programming, data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. Whether you're interested in how I've dissected and interpreted intricate survey data, or curious about my approach to analyzing trends and predicting future movements in the stock market, you'll find my work insightful.

The sales data projects, in particular, demonstrate my aptitude for merging my business acumen with my technical skills. I've delved into sales patterns, product performances, and customer behaviors, and these analyses have been instrumental in driving strategic business decisions.

Feel free to explore, learn, and get a glimpse of how data can tell compelling stories and provide actionable insights.
